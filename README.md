Data management workshop
========

LNCC/GBIF - August 25-29, 2014

Monday
--------

#### Introduction
* Overview of our software products, research areas, and metadata/data lifecycle: EML -> Morpho -> Metacat -> DataONE -> R client
* Importance of quality metadata for archiving data, now and for the future.

#### DataONE R client.
* Incorporating data and metadata available via the DataONE API in your R scripts.
* Automatic dataframe parsing for well-described tabular data.
* Saving your results back to the network (full life-cycle for synthetic data analysis!)

#### Hands-on: 
* Online data registry. Add sample data packages to a test Member Node.
* Interact with Metacat search UI and DataONE to locate those test packages.
* DOI publishing, citation, and resolution.
		
#### Hands-on: 
* Installing DataONE R client and using data uploaded in prior sessions in simple analyses and visualizations.
		
Tuesday
--------
	
#### All about Morpho.
* Describing data packages, projects, collection methods, protocols, data table attributes, etc.
* Importing and exporting data and metadata, saving to repository, making revisions, etc.


#### Hands-on: 
* Installing Morpho, troubleshooting installations, internationalization settings, etc.
* Editing existing packages.
* Extending metadata for the packages added via online registry from the previous session.
* Working with the datapackage wizard to make new packages.
* Exploring other features.
	
Wednesday (short morning)
--------------------------

* EML internationalization techniques.
* Datapackage structure in EML and OAI-ORE resource maps.
* Working with EML and the datamanager library: from quality control to data synthesis.

Thursday
--------
	
#### All about Metacat. 
* Review the features, optional components, and dependencies for running a repository.
* Using the Metacat API (deprecated) and the DataONE API to access, add, and modify content.

#### Hands-on: 
* Installing Metacat, including all dependencies (highly technical, probably use the entire morning for this)
* Perhaps do this small teams (2-3 people) rather than have each participant installing their own Metacat instance?
	
Friday
--------

#### Continuing with Metacat
* Testing the installation
* Customizing the UI
* Understanding the map and solr queries
